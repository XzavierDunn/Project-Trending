Project Trending is going to be a site that you can visit to see what is trending on twitter.

You will be able to see what is trending globally or near you.

I'm using Flask as a backend and Angular frontend for this project.

The api I will be using for my endpoints is "Tweepy"

Tweepy - http://docs.tweepy.org

Tweepy Github - https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy
