# Project Trending
### This is a site where you can see what is trending globally or near you on Twitter.

I'm using Flask as a backend and Angular frontend for this project.

No database required you only need to create an app through https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps and then use all four tokens as environment variables.

Linux/MacOS:
```
export consumer_key='API Key'
export consumer_secret='API secret key'
export access_token='Access token'
export access_token_secret='Access token secret'
```
